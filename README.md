# Full Stack Repository

Welcome to the **Full Stack Repository**! This repository is used by mentees to submit their Full Stack solutions and for mentors to review code, provide feedback, and suggest improvements.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── mentees/
│   ├── githubusername_of_mentee/
│   │   ├── Assessment1
│   │   │   ├── HtmlCSS/
│   │   │   │   ├── Task1/
|   |   |   |   |   ├──Task1.html

### Folder Breakdown:
- **`mentees/`**: Each mentee will have their own folder where they can submit their solutions to the various Full Stack problems. Mentees will create their folder with their username.

## Mentee Instructions

### 1. Fork the Repository
Each mentee must first fork this repository to their own GitHub account.

### 2. Create Your Folder
In the `mentees/` directory, create a folder with your GitHub username.

Inside your folder, create the following structure:
- **`Assessment{1,2...N}/`**
- **`Assessment{1,2...N}/HtmlCSS/`**
- **`Assessment{1,2...N}/Javascript`**

Each Task should have its own file.

### 3. Implement the Code
Write your solutions to respective folders and make sure your code is well-commented and clean.

### 4. Submit a Pull Request (PR)
Once your code is ready, commit and push your changes to your forked repository, and submit a pull request to the central repository. Your code will be reviewed by the mentors, and feedback will be provided.

Make sure your PR contains:
- **Proper commit messages**.
- **A description** of what your code is solving.
- Any **test cases** to verify correctness.

## Contribution Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**: Ensure that your code is clean, well-commented, and properly organized.
2. **Folder Naming**: Use meaningful names for folders and files. Separate algorithms and data structures logically.
3. **Testing**: Always include tests for your implementations to verify correctness.
4. **PR Etiquette**: When submitting a pull request, provide detailed explanations of your approach. Mentors will review your code and provide feedback or merge it once approved.

## Branch Protection
The `main` branch is protected, and all changes must go through the pull request process. Direct commits to the `main` branch are not allowed.
